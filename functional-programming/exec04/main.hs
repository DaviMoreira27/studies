{-
1. Receive all the plays separated by a space
2. Convert it to a list
3. In a list with K elements, get the nth element that is contained in K and
make a pair with the n + 1 element in the list ->
-> if the nth element is the number ten it will make pair with the number 0, representing a strike, 
-> if its the last frame, just add the remaining plays to the last frame
4. For each frame, check if it is a strike or spare, and calculate the score including the bonus from the next plays.
5. Sum the list of frame scores (including bonuses) to get the final match score.
6. Process the list of plays into frames (including handling of strikes and the 10th frame) ->
-> then compute the score for each frame using strike/spare rules
-> then format each frame for display, and finally show the formatted frames and total score.
